							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a Software Engineer with a strong interest in Full Stack Development. My professional goal is to work in the industry of software development, where I can help solve problems to help our society move forward with tech advancements. I am a hard-working, organized, sociable, and determined person who enjoys working both individually and in a team environment. With my 6 years of experience in the logistics industry I know first hand what it takes to be successful in a fast paced environment solving complex issues and working cross functionally. I will apply these skills when programming a new web application that aims to provide a better user experience!</p>

							<h2>My Projects</h2>
						</header>
						<p>While completing my Boot-camp with General Assembly I was able to work on Four projects, Two were individual projects and Two were Group projects. Check them out Below!</p>
						<ul class="icons-grid">
							<li>
								<a href="https://recipe-forum-client.onrender.com/main">Recipe Forum</a>
								<p class="projects">My team and I created a recipe forum application for my final project. Food has always been a place for people to come together, so we decided to make an app that allows people to share recipes and add comments and feedback on each recipe. This app was built with react using HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and Django and is hosted on a postgresSQL database. In addition, we implemented user image input utilizing Cloudinary, a massive win for our team! </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://clowning-around-client.onrender.com/">Clowning Around</a>
								<p class="projects">Clowning Around is the clown-themed forum that you never knew you needed. This was my third project and is a group project that was built with the git forking workflow. It is a full-stack app that was created using the MERN stack. What started as a joke ended up being one of the most enjoyable projects I worked on. Our team added a sense of humor to our work which made it fun. We were a team of 4 and got a lot of practice working in a group environment and troubleshooting each other's code.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://gharmon327.github.io/Campground-tracker-client/">Campground Tracker</a>
								<p class="projects">This was the second project I built and was the final of my two solo projects. For this project, I had fun and created a passion project. I am an Eagle Scout and have been passionate about camping my whole life. The campground tracker is a full-stack CRUD app that utilizes bearer token authentication. I wanted this to be an app where campground owners could come, build their campground virtually and keep track of available campsites. This project was built using HTML, vanilla JS, and CSS. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://gharmon327.github.io/blackjack-project/">Black-Jack</a>
								<p class="projects">This was the first project I built and was one of my two solo projects. For this project, I was able to code one of my favorite card games from growing up using HTML, vanilla JS, and CSS. This project was so much fun; with this being my first go at making a game, there was plenty of opportunity to solve problems and grow as a software engineer. In addition, doing this allowed me to dive in and solidify my passion for engineering. </p>
